    "1. Grate the $apple and $carrot on a medium-fine grater. < br >
     2. Grind the pre-soaked chicken. I'm just her
passed through a garlic-crush. <br>
     3. Put a saucepan with $milk on the stove < br >
     4. Add mint chicken to the pan and put out
on a shallow fire for about 10-15 minutes. To softness. < br >
     5. When the vegetable mass becomes soft, add three tbsp. spoons
$semolina. But I still have closures a little disheveled coconut flour, so I added it.
And add a slice of $butter. Since I have flour coconut, then I put $coconut oil. <br>
     6. Cool a little $carrot mass, and add one $egg.<br>
     7. Form cutlets from carrot mass and put them either on
baking paper or silicone-shaped sheet. Bake at 180g. 20 minutes.<br>
     8. Ready-made cutlets to be served with sour cream or with yogurt.

Secrets of making carrots and apples: 
1. Kuraga added to cutlets completely replaces sugar. But if you don't like her, just add sugar. 
2. You can immediately knead a double or better triple portion of cutlets and freeze most of it. There will be a ready-made, convenient semi-finished product. 
3. It is most delicious to eat these cutlets in a warm form with sour cream or with natural (not sweet) yogurt.
